# Welcome to my personal portfolio code repository.
### [-> Visit the site here <-](https://miguel-fg.github.io/portfolio-v2)

The objective of this project is to create a portfolio website to showcase my other projects as a software and web developer. 

__Milestone 1__ of this project covers the most basic features of the site and is used as submission for _Assignment #3 of CPSC 2350:Software practices_ to showcase the use of GitHub Features. For a detailed project view, visit: [CPSC 2350 Assignment 3](https://github.com/users/miguel-fg/projects/2).

__Milestone 2__ covers all of the features missing from the site, and is covered by the non-closed Issues of this repo. This will be the public-ready version of the portfolio. 

### 

# Overview

My site consists of 4 main pages: _Home_, _About_, _My Work_, and _Contact_

It has a top navigation bar that follows the standard: Logo on the left followed by navigation links and a call to action on the right.

The site's footer also has navigation links and includes links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as a download link of my full Resume and contact information.

### Home
The _homepage_ contains sections for all other pages with a button leading to them, it is supposed to act as a summary of the entire site. 

I designed the page so the _Above the Fold_ section introduces me and what I do in the shortest time possible and invites recruiters to scroll down the page to either learn more about me or my work or reach the contact form with a big-picture idea of who I am.

### About
The _About_ page contains text that follows the _PAWS_ (Personal - Academic - Work - Skills) structure, which is recommended to answer the _"Tell me about yourself."_ question. The text includes links to my academic and professional experiences.

It also has the contact form below to make it easier for the user to contact me, saving them the click and scroll to the contact page. I repeat this trend in the project page as well.

### My Work
The actual _Portfolio_ itself is the most "incomplete" of the pages, it displays the list of projects I have worked on and feel the most proud of. It uses a reusable component to make it easier to add new projects in the future.  

However, this course has made me think of the word "Project" in an entire different way, and I want to give my previous work the same level of attention as I did to this site. So, the _Learn More_ buttons on the component redirect to a fallback page while I work on refactoring my projects one by one. 

### Contact
The contact page is the simplest, as it just invites the visitor to fill out the contact form to get in touch with me (the _Submit_ button is disabled in all forms as it is outside the scope of this assignment)
